| Dawnguard Prophet Quest Bug: when Isran calls you over to chat w/Serana, Serana spawns in the troll pit and they both have no quest dialogue. | Can't fix; bug with IFD mod. If you hit this bug, use the console to move them close to each other, and then setstage to 7. Thanks to perfktmind for the solution.
