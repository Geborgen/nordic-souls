# Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Upon character creation in alternate start cell: RaceMenu light *sometimes* doesn't work, Statue of Mara *sometimes* takes a few moments to appear, clothes *sometimes* unequip | Can't fix; issue with a lot of plugins and scripts loading on game start. These issues are completely harmless anyway. |
| Character sometimes (very rarely) invisible during combat | Resolves itself, no discernable pattern |
| Death when falling to ground after Meridia raises you to sky | Being looked at; for now, use TCL or TGM in the console. [This thread has a few other solutions.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/72850/discussions/0/451848854984690733/) |
| LOTD CraftLoot auto sorter may set carry weight to the maximum negative integer (-2147483648) upon use | Being looked at; for now, avoid; reload save, or use [setav](https://skyrimcommands.com/command/setav) or [modav](https://skyrimcommands.com/command/modav) commands if encountered |
