# Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Upon character creation in alternate start cell: RaceMenu light *sometimes* doesn't work, Statue of Mara *sometimes* takes a few moments to appear, clothes *sometimes* unequip | Can't fix; issue with a lot of plugins and scripts loading on game start. These issues are completely harmless anyway. |
| Character sometimes (extremely rarely) becomes invisible in certain interiors | Resolves itself, no discernable pattern; if you get it, save and reload |
| Death when falling to ground after Meridia raises you to sky | Being looked at; for now, use TCL or TGM in the console. [This thread has a few other solutions.](https://steamcommunity.com/app/72850/discussions/0/451848854984690733/) |
| Visual issues with Penitus Oculatus armor | Being looked at |
