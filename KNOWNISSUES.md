# Known Issues

| Issue | Status |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Upon character creation in alternate start cell: RaceMenu light *sometimes* doesn't work, Statue of Mara *sometimes* takes a few moments to appear, clothes *sometimes* unequip | Can't fix; issue with a lot of plugins and scripts loading on game start. These issues are completely harmless anyway. |
| Optional NORDIC UI's markers don't have COMAP markers, leading to inconsistency | Can't fix; waiting for mod update |
| Poison Spell Crash | Being looked at |
| Character sometimes (very rarely) invisible during combat | No discernable pattern |
| Footstep sounds when jumping with spells in both hands | Being looked at |
