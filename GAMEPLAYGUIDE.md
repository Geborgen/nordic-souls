## What is Nordic Souls?

I should preface this by reiterating that this list does NOT try to turn Skyrim into another game. Instead, it tries to bring aspects from modern games into Skyrim in a way that *makes sense*. Everything has been carefully selected to fit into Skyrim's atmosphere. Everything plays together nicely, with minimal consistency issues and unnecessary fluff.

Nordic Souls is not vanilla+. Every aspect of the game has been touched in some way, from leveling to loot. It is still recognizably Skyrim, you are still playing Skyrim, but you are (obviously) playing a modified version of the game. It's modernized and streamlined to match modern standards, with *inspirations* from Dark Souls, Elden Ring, and the Witcher series. The list does NOT try to turn Skyrim into those other games.

Nordic Souls is fully SFW. Mods like CBBE with the 3BA add-on are included (with a realistic preset), but never-nude options are enabled and there are no skimpy armors or overly-sexualized body meshes.

Let's get started with the breakdown of what you can expect.

## Core Gameplay Mods

Nordic Souls uses both the [SimonRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files) and [DeltaRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3222307?tab=user+files) suites of mods, among a few others.

The vanilla boss fights and enemies have been revamped. Each Dragon Priest gives Alduin a different buff, so you should hunt down all the priests for an easier Alduin fight. Same thing with Miraak: The Solstheim Dragon Priests will buff him unless killed (killing Vahlok will buff him, however). You can take on these familiar adventures, and explore some new lands and quests as well. You'll find more interesting Draugr fights and harder dragon fights. There's also some new creatures, armor, and weapons scattered throughout the world. New powerful artifacts have been added, with existing ones balanced and overhauled.

For every mod linked below, you should familiarize yourself with their systems.

### Character Building

With new perk overhauls and various other character overhauls, you will have a familiar yet fresh experience building up your influence in Skyrim.

- [Leveling Freedom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69589) gives you control over the shape of the leveling curve in the game. You can adjust how quickly levels come at first, and how much more they cost as you level up - if any more at all. Vanilla values are set by default, but you can change them in the MCM.
- [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s human, elf, and beast races designed to balance the game’s races and add powerful new gameplay options.
- [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s perk trees designed to balance existing skills and add powerful new perks to the game.
- [Hand to Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790) is an addon for Adamant - A Perk Overhaul that merges Lockpicking and Pickpocketing into a single skill and adds a new perk tree for Hand to Hand combat.
- [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Standing Stones designed to balance the game’s stone bonuses and add powerful new gameplay options.
- [Scion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/41639) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Vampire system designed to balance existing Vampire mechanics and add powerful new vampiric abilities to the game.
- [Manbeast](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/44746) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s Werewolf system designed to balance existing Werewolf mechanics and add powerful new lycanthropic abilities to the game.

### Combat

Combat in Nordic Souls is slightly more difficult but still balanced. It's technically designed for third person; however, unlike some lists, first person combat will work perfectly fine. The full suite of beautiful combat animations by [Verolevi](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3812151) has been provided, with [FPCA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45177) for first-person animations if you choose to play that way.

- [Valhalla Combat](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/64741) adds script-free timed blocking, projectile parrying, stun and execution, and non-intrusive stamina management to push Skyrim's combat to modern standards.
- [The Ultimate Dodge Mod Reborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63000) adds a dodge mechanic with i-frames, or invincibility frames, which means you are invulnerable to damage for the duration of the dodge. The default dodge key is `ctrl`.
- [Precision](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72347) adds correct hitboxes for weapons, physics-based hit reactions, weapon trails, hitstop, camera shake, and recoils.
- [Vanguard](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/adris-projects/vanguard) slows down bash behaviors for NPC actors and gives more telegraph and balance and allows you to time to dodge or move aside.
- [Impactful Blocking](https://www.skyrim-guild.com/adris-projects/impactful-blocking) adds committed and distinct block reactions for successful blocks.
- [ZUPA](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45182) will force you into third person and show an animation while using a potion. This is to prevent potion spamming which allows you to cheese fights. You can press `G` to instantly use a healing potion, thanks to [Smart Optimal Salves](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42402).
- [Smart NPC Potions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40102) makes it so enemies sometimes carry and use a couple of potions and poisons just like you do. This will make fights fairer, more unpredictable and harder.
- [Enhanced Enemy AI](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/32063) is a script-free and lightweight improvement to combat style of all enemies. They are now smarter, making fights more challenging.
- [Wait Your Turn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/65091) is a lightweight combat add-on mod that adds circling behaviour to enemies. Now, group combat is more fair and fun for the player, as enemies will no longer attack all at once without a pattern.

### Magic

Nordic Souls doesn't add a whole lot of new spells, instead opting to improve what vanilla already provided. There are of course new spells, but overall the magic system is very streamlined and lightweight.

- [Mysticism](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27839) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s magic system designed to balance existing spells and add powerful new magical effects to the game.
- [Pilgrim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/54099) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s religion system that adds dozens of new deities and with powerful shrine effects to the game.

- [Forceful Tongue](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36276) is a lightweight shouts overhaul, designed to balance in a sensible manner this underwhelming but cool mechanic.
- [Dragon Aspect Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/29941) includes various tweaks to the Dragon Aspect power.
- [Arachnomancy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67272) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim's spider scrolls crafting system designed to balance existing spiders while adding powerful new ones to the game.
- [Oblivion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69513) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim's Atronach Forge, designed to expand its functionality.
- [Reliquary of Myth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/31612) includes balanced, lore-friendly, and unique enchantments to nearly all of Skyrim's most legendary and famous artifacts.
- [Charged Concentration](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/82317) updates the casting time for concentration spells and their magic effects such that they now take a moment to charge before the spell begins. The casting time is 0.33 seconds making them faster to cast than fire and forget spells. It gives concentration spells a bit of risk and a sense of power that was missing before.

### Alchemy

Alchemy has been overhauled with improvements to vanilla, and new systems as well.

- [Apothecary](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/52130) is a complete overhaul of Skyrim’s alchemy, food, and alcohol systems designed to balance existing options while adding powerful new effects to the game. I've included the Food & Drink add-on, which tweaks food, alcohol, and drugs.
- [Alchemy Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/80882) Improves the alchemy system with dynamic models, better item names, and more.

- [Alchemy Recipe Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85139) expands the available recipes in the base game with unused alchemy effects.

### Survival Mode

[Creation Club Survival Mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) has been overhauled with [Survival Mode Improved - SKSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/78244). You won't get any notifaction about it, just activate it normally in the gameplay menu. Nordic Souls was not built around Survival Mode and is fully optional, but it has been integrated well if you choose to play with it. You can tweak it in the Survival Control Panel MCM.

### Other Stuff

- [Cult of the World Eater](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83274) gives Alduin a series of powerful buffs which are dispelled by killing the named Dragon Priests. This encourages you to tear down the figureheads of the Dragon Cult before battling Alduin.

- [Reading Is Good](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42026) reworks skill books so that instead of granting levels instantly, they give you a permanent boost to your leveling speed in the respective skill. This means that you benefit more by reading them as soon as you find them.
- [Destructible Display Cases](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/13625) will make all display cases in the game destructible (except for Hearthfire cases). You can damage and shatter any case, regardless of its lockpick difficulty.
- [Mum's the Word](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/27713) removes the stolen tag from worthless items you steal, so long as no one notices.

- [Use Telekinesis on Traps](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59350) does exactly what it says it does.

## Quests

### Legacy of the Dragonborn

[Legacy of the Dragonborn](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802) is one of, if not the largest mod in Nordic Souls. The core is a museum, with room for thousands of unique lore-friendly items, many of which are added by the mod. You can also start the Explorer's Society faction and do many hours of quests.

Not everyone is an item hoarder, though. Something you need to keep in mind is, **the museum is completely optional!** If anything, the sheer amount of content added by LOTD was enough to add it to the list, giving life and history to the world, with a touch of nostalgia.

In addition to the main mod, I've included the [Curator's Companion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/38529) and [Safehouse Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39278) add-ons, along with countless patches for full integration.

If you want to avoid the museum entirely, [Dovahkiin's Vault](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/42237) is included. Find the key for the vault in High Hrothgar.

### New Quests

- [Wyrmstooth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/45565) is a new lands mod. The East Empire Company commissions the Dragonborn to slay a dragon that is interrupting trade routes throughout Skyrim. But is the dragon stirring up trouble with a particular reason and what sinister motive does it have for its actions?
- [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) is a questline for the Vigilants of Stendarr. It has a very dark and grim atmosphere, heavily inspired by Dark Souls. It includes a lot of unique armor sets, weapons, jewelry, creatures, and more. It is Vicn's first quest mod.
- [Unslaad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789) is Vicn's second quest mod. It is about a half-dragon, and includes fluffy equipment and creatures. Unlike Vigilant, it has a colder and sadder undertone, but also a bit of hope.
- [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time...
- [Undeath](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6180) is quest mod that gives you the option to turn into a lich. I've included the [Classical Lichdom](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/40802) add-on. When a powerful necromancer and his followers seek out the forbidden secrets of immortality that could threaten Skyrim, will you defeat him to stop his evil quest, or continue it yourself?
- [The Grand Paladin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/46867) is a quest mod involving a powerful sword. Venture beyond Skyrim, into the mists of the Sea of Ghosts, and uncover the legacy of an ancient Dragonborn order.

Like in the Witcher 3, bring "trophies" from your enemy to the Jarl as proof of the bounty or deliver the captured bandits to a guard for justice.
- [BUVARP](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56120) gives new purposes to NPCs that are barely used in Vanilla. In many cases, they are quest NPCs that get deleted by the game after their quests.

- [Paarthurnax - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51711) is a fully voiced, quite expanded new take on the quest Paarthurnax, giving both the Blades and Paarthurnax good reasons for their stances, and you, Dragonborn, the final choice.
- [Nilheim - Misc Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/53792) fixes some issues with the misc quest at Nilheim and gives a bit more flexibility to your encounter with good old Telrav, adding a couple of additional dialogue choices and options for roleplaying.
- [House of Horrors - Quest Expansion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/57285) expands Molag Bal's daedric quest, giving you the option of choosing an alternative "good guy" route to finish the vanilla quest. Fully voiced, with new scenes and a custom reward: a new follower!

[Check here for the Nordic Souls quest condition changes.](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/.github/QUESTCHANGES.md)
- [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) is a compilation of adjustments to the Thieves Guild and its related quests.

[Check here for the Nordic Souls Thieve's Guild condition changes.](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/.github/THIEVESGUILD.md)

## Followers and NPCs

- [Nether's Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55653) is a multi-follower system that is light on game resources and allows for up to 10 companions at one time. It provides a wealth of additional features, including immersion and quality-of-life functions to allow you to adventure with a small team of characters. **If you get a prompt asking you to import a custom follower (such as Inigo) into NFF, select no.**

- [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking he won't chatter and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in archery, one-handed, and sneak. He is also my favorite follower. You can find him in the Riften prison.
- [Lucien](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/20035) is a fully voiced Imperial follower with over 5000 lines of immersive, lore-friendly dialogue.

You can find him at the Dead Man's Drink Inn in Falkreath.
- [Kaidan](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/19075) is a romantic follower featuring over 1200 lines of dialogue, custom home, and mini quests. You can begin looking for him by asking Orgnar at the Sleeping Giant Inn in Riverwood if anything interesting is happening in town.

- [Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874) is a Breton engineer who will accompany you in your travels. She's travelled from Wayrest to explore Dwemer ruins in Skyrim, but she needs your help. While she's not much of a fighter, she boasts a knack for machinery and will reprogram a dwemer spider to fight alongside you both. You can find her at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth
- [Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893) is a custom fully voiced Argonian lawman of House Telvanni with ~4150 lines. He is on his way to Rivenspire in High Rock, having traveled all the way from Port Telvannis in Morrowind. Xelzaz has just arrived in Skyrim and is looking for a traveling companion. In return he will keep you company, cook you warm meals and brew powerful potions. You can start looking for him by finding a note on the wall in the Bee and Barb Inn in Riften.
- [Garm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68873) is a fierce husky companion. What more do you need? He can be found with Andurs at the Temple of Arkay in Whiterun.

## Player Homes

In addition to the [Creation Club houses](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Houses#Creation_Club_HousesCC), I've added a few custom player homes. Some of them will require you to use the power from [Hearthfire Multiple Adoptions](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3862) if you want your family to move in (open the wheel menu and select `Bless Home`).

- [Mörskom Estate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33408) is a large player home situated on the hillside of Dawnstar.

Depending on your play style, Mörskom can be rebuilt using skill and materials or paid workers.

- [Riverside Lodge](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/9567) is a picturesque and fully equipped player home between Whiterun and Riverwood. You can find the key in the chest ouside the front door. This is a good starter home, as it's technically free.
- [Viking's Longhouse](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10860) is a nordic themed player home near Windhelm, simple yet cozy for a nord warrior.
- [Elysium Estate](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/4119) is a mid-sized, lore friendly home located near Whiterun for you, or with family and followers. Full of foliage, fountains, features to customize, optional displays, crafting and plenty more.
