## What is Nordic Souls?

1200+ mods can change the game quite a bit. However, I should preface this by reiterating that this list does NOT try to turn Skyrim into another game. Instead, it tries to modernize Skyrim in a way that *makes sense*. Everything has been carefully selected to fit into Skyrim's atmosphere, and the mods play together nicely, with minimal consistency issues and unnecessary fluff. Despite this, every aspect of the game has been touched in some way, bringing a familiar yet new experience.

Nordic Souls is fully SFW. Mods like CBBE with the 3BA add-on are included (with a realistic preset), but never-nude options are enabled and there are no skimpy armors or overly-sexualized body meshes.

Let's get started with the breakdown of what you can expect.

## Core Gameplay Mods

Nordic Souls uses the [SimonRim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/67410746?tab=user+files) suite of mods, which includes mods by Simon as well as [Delta](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/3222307?tab=user+files) and many other authors. All of these mods provide a consistent gameplay experience that fits perfectly into the list. It's semi-vanilla+ but also quite refreshing.

The vanilla boss fights and enemies have been revamped. Each Dragon Priest gives Alduin a different buff, so you should hunt down all the priests for an easier Alduin fight. Same goes for Miraak: The Solstheim Dragon Priests will buff him unless killed (killing Vahlok will buff him, however). You can take on these familiar adventures, and explore some new lands and quests as well. You'll find more interesting Draugr fights and harder dragon fights. You'll find loads of new armor and weapon variants, and overhauled artifacts. You can find vendors that sell new and exciting spells.

Gameplay is more difficult than vanilla, but also fair. For example, dragons are much harder, but you don't have to fight them randomly until you kill Sahloknir. Draugr are more powerful, but barely use shouts anymore. You won't be able to cheese your way through everything. SimonRim provides a lot of tools for preparation and buffs, which you should use to have an easier time.

### Mods To Familiarize Yourself With

From perks to leveling to combat, there are a lot of mods that make up the gameplay elements of the list. You should know what you're getting into. Take a look at the mods linked below so  that you can become familiar with them.

<details>
<summary>Core SimonRim(+) Suite (expand)</summary>

- [Aetherius](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/26686) and [Mundus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33411) handle races and standing stones.
- [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191), [Hand to Hand](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/59790), and [Ascension](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/89223) overhaul perks.

[Sorcerer](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/95196) improves staff and scroll mechanics, and allows you to craft new ones.

Combat is designed to work well in both first and third-person, with new animations for both gameplay styles. *Dodge is locked behind the Agility light armor perk.*
- [Oblivion](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69513) and [Arachnomancy](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/67272) overhaul the atronach forge and spider scrolls, respectively.

<summary>Traits (expand)</summary>

[Biggie Traits - Refitted](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/150223) provides a unique trait system. Once you create your character, you can use the Select Traits power. I've cut a decent amount of overpowered traits, and rebalanced a few as well. The included traits should provide a lot of build variety.

#### Procedure to reset traits (copied from the mod page):

1. Open console and type the following: `player.additem FE2730CE 1` or type `help slate` to find ID of '_Potion of Blank Slate_' or look up ID under Ingestibles in xEdit. This will grant you a potion that will remove all traits. Drink the potion. 
2. In console again, type the following: `player.addspell Traits_SelectionSpell`  
This will grant you the power to pick traits again. Use the power to pick any trait.
3. (optional) If you wish to change traits again after the first reset, the power will be locked in power menu for some reason, so you will need to remove it and re-add it again.  
Type in console: `player.removespell Traits_SelectionSpell` and repeat steps 1 and 2.
  
Remember to always save before messing with console stuff just in case something doesn't go right.

<summary>Dodge (expand)</summary>

[TK Dodge RE](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/56956) and the [Addon](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/125238) allow for a dodge ability. You can unlock this ability with the `Agility` light armor perk. 

The dodge key is bound to sprint, so tap `Alt` to dodge, and hold it to sprint. If you have a mouse with side buttons, you can also press `M5` to dodge. If you use gamepad, tap `LB` to dodge, and hold it to sprint. To edit the keybinds, find the `TK Dodge` MCM.

By default, the dodge style is set to step dodge. If you want to switch to a roll, you can go to `Nordic Souls\mods\NS - Game Settings\SKSE\Plugins\TK Dodge RE.ini` and set `StepDodge` to `false`.

You can adjust how quickly levels come at first, and how much more they cost as you level up - if any more at all. Vanilla values are set by default, but you can change them in the MCM.
- You can interact with objects you wouldn't normally be able to. [Adamant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30191) has perks that let you develop your skills as a bard, and [Sweeping Organizes Stuff](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51645) lets you use a broom to clean up physics messes.

- There is a lot more. Take a look at the [load order](https://loadorderlibrary.com/lists/nordic-souls).

</details>

### Creation Club

[Creation Club](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Creation_Club) content has been fixed, balanced, and integrated into the world through several different mods. Certain quests have been disabled, namely the Alternative Armors quests, in favor of world integration. See the [quest changes](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/QUESTCHANGES.md) document for more information on CC quest changes.

- [RAE - Quest Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/61004) changes start conditions for some CC quests. For this list, they have default values. This can be tweaked in the MCM.
- [Skyrim Extended Cut - Saints and Seducers](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72772) lets you return to the Shivering Isles in a fully-voiced overhaul of Skyrim's Saints and Seducers Creation.
- [Creation Club Survival Mode](https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Skyrim:Survival_Mode) has been overhauled with [Starfrost](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97536). You won't get any notification about it, just activate it normally in the gameplay menu. Nordic Souls was not built around Survival Mode and is fully optional, but it has been integrated well if you choose to play with it. It is much more lightweight, read through the mod page if you choose to enable it.
- [Goldenhills Plantation](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69029), [Myrwatch](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/97659), and [Hendraheim](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/98688) have been overhauled.
- [Masterwork](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/142109) overhauls CC artifacts.

## Quests

In addition new content, Nordic Souls changes the starting requirements for quite a few quests as well. As the list is a bit extensive, I've put the changes in a document [here](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/QUESTCHANGES.md). If you can't start a quest, it is likely because you haven't met the correct conditions, and you should check that document.

### Vanilla Quest Changes

There are several changes to vanilla quests, to balance them and provide new role-playing opportunities. 

- All of [JaySerpa](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/users/5201727?tab=user+files)'s quest expansion series is included, in addition to his dialogue expansions and various other mods.
- [Cult of the World Eater - Dragon Priests Buff Alduin](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83274) gives Alduin a series of powerful buffs which are dispelled by killing the named Dragon Priests. This encourages you to tear down the figureheads of the Dragon Cult before battling Alduin.
- [Cult of the True Dragonborn - Immersive Miraak Difficulty](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/83458) does a similar thing but for Miraak's Dragon Priests (except killing Vahlok which will only strengthen him...)
- [Defeat the Dragon Cult](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/86625) adds a quest pointing you towards and offering incentive to kill the Dragon Priests.
- [Timing is Everything](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/25464) changes start conditions for some vanilla quests.
- [Thieves Guild Requirements](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/33256) changes start conditions for Thieves Guild quests.
- [Delayed Quest Starts](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/72751) changes the starting requirements for a few other quests.

### New Quests

A few high-quality DLC-sized quest mods are included, with a bunch of smaller adventures as well. Overall, there is dozens of hours of new content for your character to experience.

- [Beyond Skyrim - Bruma](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/10917) is a massive mod that allows you to travel beyond the borders of Skyrim and explore Bruma, the northernmost county in Cyrodiil.

- [Olenveld](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/133579) is a new lands mod, the size of a small DLC, bringing the lore-rich location of Olenveld to Skyrim. Olenveld is referenced in the book "The Exodus" in Skyrim, telling a tale both eerie and intriguing. This small island, a day’s sail north of Winterhold with good winds, was long forgotten and is said to have been used by Tiber Septim as a burial ground for his conquest's casualties—a haunting landmass filled with the fallen.
- [Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849) is a questline for the Vigilants of Stendarr. It has a very dark and grim atmosphere, heavily inspired by Dark Souls. It includes a lot of unique armor sets, weapons, jewelry, creatures, and more.

- [Unslaad](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11789) is a quest mod about a half-dragon, and includes fluffy equipment and creatures. Unlike Vigilant, it has a colder and sadder undertone, but also a bit of hope. Check [this document](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/QUESTCHANGES.md) for the updated starting conditions. Recommended as the finale for your character.
- [Sirenroot](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70917) is a dialogue-heavy quest with puzzles, platforming, and a focus on water mechanics. You and a team of divers are hired to scour ruins at the bottom of Lake Honrich.
- [The Forgotten City](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1179) is the first mod in history to win a national Writers' Guild award for its script. It is a critically acclaimed expansion mod offering a unique 6 - 8 hour experience: a murder mystery investigation set in an ancient underground city. You'll need to solve it using your wits, and the ability to travel through time... (level 25+ required).
- [Siege at Icemoth](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/109541) is a small scale vanilla-esque new lands mod adding some new islands with new locations and dungeons in the Sea of Ghosts. To travel to the isles, you'll need to reach the Old Wooden Jetty at the most north western beach in Skyrim.
- [Gravewind](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/129582) is a quest about a realm lost to myth, an ancient city of ghosts, and a small house in the woods. Travel just northwest of the Roadside Ruins in Falkreath, and enter the abandoned homestead; you will be trapped inside. Recommended level 25+.
- [Demon of Dream](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118719) is a Daedric quest in which you enter the nightmares of three ex-cultists of Vaermina

- [Calling the Watchmaker](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/96711) is a quest mod featuring an extremely unique story that delves into the creation myth of the Elder Scrolls universe.
- [The Breathing Abyss](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/104547) is an ocean-based quest mod centered around finding out what a mysterious entity is, where it's from, and how it can be stopped.
- [Depths of the Soul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118261) features a rather helpful merchant who will aid the player by selling various items for dungeons.
- Several mods by [nimwraith](https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/nimwraith/mods?gameId=1704) are included. Discover these as you travel.

## Followers

Nordic Souls includes some of the best custom followers available, and overhauls vanilla follower systems as well.

- [Busy Follower Framework](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/112076) aims to provide the most immersive and intuitive experience for base followers in the game by enhancing their base functionality and adding additional features such as renaming, home assignment, outfits, teaching, looting and much more.

- [Inigo](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1461) is a fully voiced khajiit adventuring companion with over 7000 lines of unique dialogue - much of it about you. He'll level alongside you and avoid most traps. If you're sneaking he won't chatter and he'll whisper if you talk to him. He can run out of arrows. He's highly skilled in archery, one-handed, and sneak. You can find him in the Riften prison.
- [Auri](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11278) is a traditionalist Wood Elf archer. You can find her house somewhere in the Falkreath pine forest.
- [Katana](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/69622) is a not-so-roguish rogue with mysterious powers. The mod also introduces Megara, a healer with a knack for getting information. You can find Katana in the Winking Skeever Inn in Solitude.
- [Gore](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/85298) is a fully voiced, lore-friendly, standalone follower. His story is small-scale, low-stakes, believable, and fits within the lore, so as not to overshadow your own story and is completely optional. You can find him at Peaks Shade Tower, outside of Falkreath.
- [Remiel](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/51874) is a Breton engineer who will accompany you in your travels. She's traveled from Wayrest to explore Dwemer ruins in Skyrim, but she needs your help. While she's not much of a fighter, she boasts a knack for machinery and will reprogram a dwemer spider to fight alongside you both. You can find her at the Silver-Blood Inn in Markarth
- [Xelzaz](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/62893) is a custom fully voiced Argonian lawman of House Telvanni with ~6200 lines. He is on his way to Rivenspire in High Rock, having traveled all the way from Port Telvannis in Morrowind. Xelzaz has just arrived in Skyrim and is looking for a traveling companion. In return he will keep you company, cook you warm meals and brew powerful potions. You can start looking for him by finding a note on the wall in the Bee and Barb Inn in Riften.
- [Redcap](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/73441) is a unique, voice-acted, immersive follower mod with over 2400 lines of dialogue, a ton of fun and useful features, several new quests, new locations, interactive commentary on many quests, and a pet boar named Bigpig who he can summon in battle. You will find him locked in the basement of Anise's Cabin.
- [Garm](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/68873) is a fierce husky companion. What more do you need? He can be found with Andurs at the Temple of Arkay in Whiterun.
