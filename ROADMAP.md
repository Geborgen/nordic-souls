# Roadmap
This roadmap is made for modlist version 1.3 and onward. Previous versions are not listed because I didn't feel like it and I also didn't know where this list would go. Please note that this roadmap is not exhaustive, and I've left some things out and will not be updating it that frequently.

## Version 1.3
Aiming for release around Christmas, maybe later but probably not sooner. Will require a new game.

**Definitely:**

- SimonRim updates: Scion 2 and Manbeast 2
- Daedric Shrines AIO
- Saints & Seducers Extended Cut
- Xelzaz update
- Kaidan 2 update (add-ons from the new website)
- College of Winterhold Quest Expansion
- Formlist Manipulator + patches
- Skyrim Landscape & Water Fixes
- More mesh fixes
- USMP, which removes the need for a bunch of small fixes and tweaks I added previously
- A new player home :O
- Some new animations, nothing too crazy
- Another patching re-work, as the current patching is still rather sloppy
- Update a lot of mods, naturally
- Remove Khajiit Has Wares due to fps issues
- Remove Immersive Fort Dawnguard due to various issues
- Remove Serana Dialogue Add-on due to list theming and taste issues (replaced with Serana Dialogue Edit)
- Remove Undeath due to keeping everything streamlined and bug-free. More of a personal decision here

**Maybe:**

- Simon's artifact mod, if it releases in time. I will weigh it against RoM


## Future Updates
By future, I mean distant future.

- Definitely Ryn's Skyrim AIO when that releases
- Inigo v3, one day perhaps
- Glenmoril if it ever gets finished
- Odyssey of the Dragonborn
