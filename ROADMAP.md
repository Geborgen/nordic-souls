# Roadmap
This roadmap is made for modlist version 1.3 and onward. Previous versions are not listed because I didn't feel like it and I also didn't know where this list would go. Please note that this roadmap is not exhaustive, and I've left some things out and will not be updating it that frequently.

## Version 1.4
RELEASE DATE TBD, REQUIRES NEW GAME

I need to hone in on what this list is really about. It definitely works, is stable, and is fun. But I have always felt like something is missing. The list is centered around LotD, RoM, ArteFakes, and OWL. In other words, artifacts are the endgame and unique items are what you should be striving to use. I need to balance this more, remove a lot of fluff, and have more hand-placed things (for example, there are some really cool armor sets out there that don't have world integration).

I'm also not happy with the performance, or at least, MY performance. I get 40-50 FPS in exteriors, as stated in the readme, but there are areas where I get lots of stuttering, even without ENB. I need to streamline it more. COTN will be removed, Fortified Whiterun as well probably. Spaghetti's cities ftw. I'll re-think LOD settings. There are also a bunch of optimization things I can do. I know it runs good for people with RTX card, but I'm still stuck on a GTX 1060. Skill issue I guess. I definitely don't want to make the list look any worse.

This brings me to ENB. I want to add more of them. I tried to add ENB Organizer before but it didn't work. I didn't really delve into it however, so I'll give it another shot. Currently, I'm thinking about PI-CHO, Silent Horizons, Ominous, Culinated, and Weather Is Sacred as alternatives. Rudy will always be the list default. ENB Organizer will make it harder to add your own ENBs, but I'll try to add different options. I'm always open to suggestions for this.

Overall it's becoming a pain to maintain the list, but that just happens with the amount of mods I have. I will do some trimming down. Despite my frustrations, I'm excited for the future of this modlist.

- SimonRim updates
- MAYBE Simon's artifact mod, depending on release date, will weigh against RoM
- ENB Organizer with some different ENB options
- All tools shipped and installed natively
- Remove COTN, every city will be Spaghetti-ified
- VAE 2.0
- Ish's Respec Mod
- Cult of the World Eater - Dragon Priests Buff Alduin
- Some form of leveling change. Not sure what yet. Skill Uncapper? Experience? I have work to do.
- MAYBE more armor and weapons
- Replace The Dragon Cult with Haugbui to fix draugr balancing
- MAYBE tweak dragons too
- Fix some AI stuff, and play with EVGAT (probably will keep it but undecided)
- Change some of the custom creatures

## Future Updates
By future, I mean distant future.

- Definitely Ryn's Skyrim AIO when that releases
- Inigo v3, one day perhaps
- Glenmoril if it ever gets finished
- Odyssey of the Dragonborn (either that or Extended Cut, either way it'll be in a 2.0 version of the list. Way in the future, haven't even started thinking about it)
