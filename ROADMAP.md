# Roadmap
This roadmap is made for modlist version 1.3 and onward. Previous versions are not listed because I didn't feel like it and I also didn't know where this list would go

## Version 1.3
Aiming for release around Christmas, maybe sooner but probably not later. Will require new game. Sorry. Hopefully a month and a half is enough for a full playthrough
- SimonRim updates. Scion 2 is out, with Manbeast 2 following soon.
- Speaking of SimonRim, his Artificer mod is on the horizon. I will likely replace RoM with that.
- Daedric Shrines AIO.
- Ryn's Skyrim?????
- Saints & Seducers Extended Cut??????????
- Hopefully Untarnished UI gets an update relatively soon, the screenshots of the WIP update for that mod look awesome
- Xelzaz got a large update apparently
- VC perk integration when :( hopefully by then (call me eminem)

## Future Updates
- Definitely Ryn's Skyrim AIO when that releases
- Inigo v3 where are youuuuu
- I will not add Skyrim: Extended Cut (maybe in another modlist if I feel like ever making another modlist... that is wayy in the future)
