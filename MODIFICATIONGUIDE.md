# Modification Guide

You are not guaranteed official support for modifying the list in any way, and you will void support for issues you encounter if you do. As mentioned in the [readme](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/README.md), Wabbajack's "rule 11" states that any modifications you make are done at your own risk. 

In the case of Nordic Souls, the list is often praised for how easily modifiable it is and how active the community around it is as well, so if you follow a few general guidelines and have a basic understanding of modding, you should have no trouble making the list your own.

It should be stated again that you do this at your own risk, and you are soley responsible for anything that breaks, whether or not you follow this guide. This guide will not provide incorrect information and will not intentionally try to break anything. This is not a step-by-step guide, as modding is a unique process for everyone, rather it is a list of things to pay attention to and to keep in mind as you make your modifications. With that out of the way, let's get started.
