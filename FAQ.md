# FAQ

## Q: Do I have to read this?

**A:** No, but if you ask a question that is in this document, you will be referred here.

## Q: Why does my character look broken and glitchy?

**A:** You unlocked MO2 when launching the game. When you get the pop-up after launching, do not unlock. This will unload files, causing strange issues.

## Q: My game crashes as soon as I try to launch it.

**A:** Reinstall the list to verify any missing/broken files. If you still have issues, go back and make sure you have all prerequisits (.NET, etc.). Install them even if you think you have them. **Make sure you have disabled OneDrive.**

## Q: Why is my game window super zoomed-in?

**A:** Go to your `Game Root` folder, right-click `SkyrimSE.exe`, go to `Properties`, and follow the steps outlined [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lost-Outpost/resources/main/skyrim-scaling.png).

## Q: How do I change my FOV?

**A:** first use the FOV console command like normal (`fov x`). Then, enter the `Improved Alternate Conversation Camera` MCM. There, you can find an FOV slider. This sets the FOV you will return to when exiting dialogue, preventing it from resetting.

## Q: How do I change my brightness?

**A:** In the ENB menu, go to the `ENVIRONMENT` category, and edit settings such as `AmbientLightingIntensityDay` and `AmbientLightingIntensityNight`. If you break something, you can press `LOAD CONFIGURATION` at the top to restore your previous configuration, or reinstall the list to reset everything to default.

## Q: How do I get rid of those obnoxious category icons at the top of the inventory menu?

**A:** Enter the `SkyUI` MCM, go to `General`, change `Category Icon Theme to `SkyUI V5`.

## Q: Why does X quest not start?

**A:** There are likely different starting requirements. Please refer to [this](https://github.com/Geborgen/nordic-souls/blob/main/.github/QUESTCHANGES.md) document.

## Q: Why are no dragons spawning?

**A:** This is due to the [Diplomatic Dragons](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/70803) mod. Random dragons will not spawn until Sahloknir dies.
